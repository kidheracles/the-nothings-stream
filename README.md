### After [the Nothings Suite](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/)

_Nothing to see here! Nothing to entertain you, make you laugh._

> "To Whom / No subject / No image / No taste / No object / No beauty / No message / No talent / No technique (no why) / No idea / No intention / No art / No object / No feeling / No black / No white (no and) / After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in these paintings that could not be changed, that they can be seen in any light and are not destroyed by the action of shadows. / Hallelujah! the blind can see again; the waterâ€™s fine."\
-- _John Cage on Robert Rauschenberg's White Paintings (1951)_
